With a large number of Americans filing for bankruptcy every year many are asking, what are the causes? Many attribute it to the real estate meltdown back in 2007 and others blame the credit industry for their lackadaisical attitude on how they give credit cards to individuals. In most cases currently, the perfect storm has been created starting with the real estate market collapse. After the real estate market collapsed, the rest of the economy got drug down with it. These individuals that were living beyond their means are no longer making the easy money that they were in the past.

Every industry suffered, when the credit market dried up, families were no longer taking extravagant vacations and buying new cars. When individuals stop making the money they were in the past or even worse were unemployed, they started to slide down the financial slope into oblivion. The first thing that happens is choices have to be made about eliminating any luxuries. If that doesn't help, the decision needs to be made of which bills to pay and which to default on. This is where the wheels start to come off and the individual should be rushing in to see a bankruptcy attorney immediately. Usually, this is where people that have no available credit on their credit cards, start to look into payday loans. Payday loans in theory, are not a bad thing if they are used for an emergency to get quick cash. But when this is the only money available to survive on, it will lead to disaster.
