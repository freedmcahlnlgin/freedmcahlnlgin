You pay your bills on time, you earn sufficient income, and then why are payday loan lenders the only ones willing to work with you? It is time to do some detective work on your own and find out why other creditors are steering clear from your applications. Most often, the answer can be found right within your credit report.

You know something is wrong somewhere. It will now be your job to find it. The three credit bureaus offer a free credit report every 12 months in order for you to keep better track of your finances. Use one report every four months to keep the best tabs on your credit all year long.

Take a look at the report:

* Do you find anything unfamiliar?

* Is there an error anywhere?

* Is all your personal information reported correctly? Check your address, Social Security number, date of birth and the spelling of your name to make sure there is nothing being misreported.
